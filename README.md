# Herd-Immunity-calculator
Simple calculator that calculates herd immunity threshold when given a R<sub>0</sub> rate.

The calculator is based on the following formula:

(R<sub>0</sub> − 1) / R<sub>0</sub>

where:

R<sub>0</sub> = basic reproduction number: the number of individuals an infected person infects when the rest of the population is susceptible

The calculator will furthermore generate a number of general cases for a variety of R<sub>0</sub> rates.

The following is an example for a R<sub>0</sub> rate of 3:
