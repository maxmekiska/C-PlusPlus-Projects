# Herd-Immunity-calculator
Simple calculator that calculates herd immunity threshold when given a R<sup>0</sup> rate.

The calculator is based on the following formula:

(R<sup>0</sup> − 1) / R<sup>0</sup>

where:

R<sup>0</sup> = basic reproduction number: the number of individuals an infected person infects when the rest of the population is susceptible

The calculator will furthermore generate a number of general cases for a variety of <sup>0</sup> rates.

The following is an example for a R<sup>0</sup> rate of 3:
