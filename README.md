# Herd-Immunity-calculator
Simple calculator that calculates herd immunity threshold when given a R_0 rate.

The calculator is based on the following formula:

(R_0 − 1) / R_0

where:

R_0 = basic reproduction number: the number of individuals an infected person infects when the rest of the population is susceptible

The calculator will furthermore generate a number of general cases for a variety of R0 rates.

The following is an example for a R_0 rate of 3:
